# AP-2 Versuch 90 - Gamma spectroscopy

You can find the code for the analysis in _main.py_. The functions and parameters should be pretty self explanatory. Still there are some comments that state their purpose.

The raw data is saved as txt. files. To read them in, you can put them in a folder and specify the path name of that folder on your computer as the _folder_path_ at the very top of the main file. After that you just need to call _createPlot()_ with the measurement and background measurment file_path_names. For more capabilities check out the optional parameters.
